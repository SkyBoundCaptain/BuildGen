# BuildGen
BuildGen Project for CS 290. The purpose of BuildGen is to generate and post, through written descriptions, rooms and buildings for games such as D&amp;D and Pathfinder. The practical use of this is for Game Masters, who can use this to quickly find and/or create rooms and the insides of buildings for use in making towns, cities, dungeons, etc.
