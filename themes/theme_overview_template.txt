On the very first line is the total number of lines in the text file.
This can be used in for loops to know the number of iterations needed for the loop.
After that, on lines 2 through x, there are descriptors in line with the theme described in the file name
The only difference between the _overview.txt files and the theme.txt files is that these descriptors are explictly
tailored toward describing the overall feel of the room.
Each line is its own contained/standalone descriptor. For example...
The building is a small one; it looks to have once been a miniature ball room, but time has eroded it. It's floor is a smooth mahogany wood that has rotted away in certain spots. The pine wood walls are framed with cobblestone that runs into the ceiling, which is lined with dusty, cobweb-infested chandlers.
The room is made of brick with a smooth stone floor. Dust floats in the air, and things look worn.
