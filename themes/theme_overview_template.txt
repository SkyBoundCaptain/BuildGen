On the very first line is the total number of lines in the text file.
This can be used in for loops to know the number of iterations needed for the loop.
After that, on lines 2 through x, there are descriptors in line with the theme described in the file name
The only difference between the _overview.txt files and the theme.txt files is that these descriptors are explictly
tailored toward describing the overall feel of the room.
Each line is its own contained/standalone descriptor. For example...
The room is made of brick with a smooth stone floor. Dust floats in the air, and things look worn.
