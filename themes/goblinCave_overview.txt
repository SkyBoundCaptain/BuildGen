The ground is peppered with blood stains; the smell of iron and raw meat is in the air.
The air is humid and damp. You hear dripping all around you, and see growing fungus and lichen lining the ground, roof and walls.
The air is dry and stale, the scent of something dead and decaying assails your senses.
The ground beneath your feet is gravely, uneven, and damp. Water trickles down from the walls down into the floor before gathering near the edges. It exits through small cracks and tunnels no larger than a handâ€™s width. 
The room is filled with heat and the stone floor is warm to the touch. This hissing of water can be heard nearby; perhaps a steam vent?
