To add in a new theme, create a "themeName.txt" and a "themeName_overview.txt" file.
On lines after the first, add in whatever text/description you desire.
Note: One description per line. The program considers a single line a single description.

After you've made your themeName.txt and a themeName_overview.txt file, add these into the "buildgen.js" file
by reading them in, using .split("\n") to split them into arrays of strings seperated by newline, and then adding
your themeName and themeName_overview files to the themeArr and theme_overviewArr arrays respectively.
Note: whatever your theme name, make sure to add "Room" at the end for the keyname. Ex: Spooky Room.

Once this is done, add in the name of your theme to the "themeList.json" file
