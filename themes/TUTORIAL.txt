To add in a new theme, create a themeName.txt and a themeName_overview.txt file.
On the first line, put a number that represents the total number of lines in the file. 
MAKE SURE THIS IS ACCURATE. Otherwise, certain descriptions will not be read or a seg fault may occur.
On lines after the first, add in whatever text/description you desire.
Note: One description per line. The program considers a single line a single description.

After you've made your themeName.txt and a themeName_overview.txt file, add these into the buildgen.js file
by reading them in, using .split("\n") to split them into arrays of strings seperated by newline, and then adding
your themeName and themeName_overview files to the themeArr and theme_overviewARR arrays respectively.
