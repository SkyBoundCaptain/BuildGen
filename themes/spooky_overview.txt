The room is small and eroded by time. Its floor is a smooth mahogany wood that has rotted away in certain spots. The pine wood walls are framed with cobblestone that runs into the ceiling, which is lined with dusty, cobweb-infested chandlers.
Smoothed stone floors and oak plank walls make up the room. The air is musty, and the ceiling has holes and cracks in it.
The smell of iron overwhelms the room. On its stone walls are large blood spatters and dried chunks of gore.
The room appears to have been through a fire; its objects are burnt, some turned to charcoal, others covered in soot.
