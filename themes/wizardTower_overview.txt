Throughout the room, floating neon lights illuminate the floor and ceiling. Each brick is carved with a spiraling figure.
The room is illuminated in a source, light blue light that casts no shadows. Your hair begins to stand up, and tiny jolts of energy bounce about the room
The smell of cinnabons, hot chocolate, and crumpets fill the air as a chandelier casts a natural light through the room.
Small piles of books and loose notes are scattered across the room. Occasionally a book from one pile will swap places with another. The loose paper occasionally is picked up as if from an unseen wind, before flying through the air into a book, or forming a stack. Candles float in the air for lighting.
Candelabras placed systematically through the room light it. Across the whole room is a massive painting depicting the cosmos.
