A corpse lays curled up in the fetal position in a pool of blood.
Skeletons make a mound that reaches up to the ceiling. Arms, legs, and skulls poke out in random spots.
A chair is turned to face toward one of the walls. On it is a skeleton who looks up at the ceiling, its mouth wide open.
A broken chandiler lies on the floor and is slumped up against a pile of rubble. It is made of copper and cloaked in cobwebs.
Holes line every inch of the ground; fecal lies inside, and rats poke their heads out to sniff for food.
There is a small table. It's warped, made of rusted iron and covered with splatters of blood. On it are various bloodied tools and weapons.
There is a shrine of bone and melted wax candles made to a creature flayed on the wall. It's intestines spill out and droop down to touch the floor.
Corpses kowtoe to a stake. On the stake is a humanoid with beast-like features; its face is twisted into hideous snarl.
Wide streaks of blood line the floor. They start and end abruptly.
There is a small wooden table lined with gashes. On it is a weathered, yellowed map spotted with blood.
