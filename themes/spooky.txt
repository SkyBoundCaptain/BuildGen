A corpse lies in a pool of its own blood, curled into fetal position.
Skeletons are bunched together in a mound of bone.
A chair is turned to face toward the wall. On it is a skeleton who looks up at the ceiling, its mouth hanging wide open.
A broken chandiler lies on the floor and is slumped up against the wall. It is made of copper and cloaked in cobwebs.
Holes line every inch of the wall; fecal matter drips down onto the floor, and rats poke their heads out to sniff for food.
A small table is tucked into the corner. It's warped, made of rusted iron and covered with splatters of blood. On it are various bloodied tools and weapons.
Nothing.
