Spoils hang from racks strewn about haphazardly above the floor. The treasure of negligent merchants and foolish adventurers alike dangles within reach; there are spices, food, coin, weapons, and armor of varying qualities. 
Barricades of spikes point outwards. The skeletons of the deceased hang from where they met their demise.
What could be recognized as a stone “table” is coated in dried blood. Makeshift, damaged knives and cleavers lay on the table. Meat hooks are fashioned near the table, allowing quarries to be skinned and chopped above it. Beside the table is a bucket of who-knows-what.
Makeshift sleeping bags of animal skin and burlap dot the floor. Some are stuffed with hay or soft moss. Others are stuffed with grass or guts.
A jagady stone few features rests. On closer inspection, scratch marks can be seen. This is likely where the goblins would sharpen their claws.
There is a smooth, relatively level outcopping covered with paintings. Depictions of goblin battles and "art" is drawn on this outcropping.
The area is filled with boulders that have scattered across the floor. Pilfered rope and pins are haphazardly used to prevent more rocks from falling from above.
Half Broken crates and torn bags of food are scattered everywhere. Flies swarm overhead, and what little vegetables the goblins seem willing to eat lays side-by-side with raw meat.
A large chair placed upon a bone pile is the focal point of this section; torches burn on either side, and animal rugs lead up to the seat.
A pile of bones, iron scrap, and cloth stands next to a table of make-shift tools. Some small pieces of “clothes” and armor lie on the table.
