Racks of spoils hang from above and all along the floor, strewn about haphazardly. The treasure of unwitting merchants and foolish adventurers alike. Spices, food, coin, weapons, and armor of varying qualities. 
Barricades of spikes pointing outwards. The skeletons of the deceased hang from where they met their demise.
What counts as a stone “table” is coated in dried blood. Makeshift, damaged knives and cleaves lay on the table. Meat hooks are fashioned to stand near the table where the denizens can reach. A bucket of who-knows-what lay besides it.
Sleeping racks and bags. Some filled with hay or soft moss for softer bedding. Others with a worn animal hide that was probably not tanned properly.
A jagady stone with little features to make out at first glance. On closer inspection however, it is clear that it is covered in scratch marks, likely where the goblins would sharpen their claws.
A “smooth,” relatively level outcopping covered with paintings. Depictions of their battles, and what some might consider “art.”
The area is filled with fallen boulders that also are also scattered about the floor. Pilfered rope and pins are haphazardly used to prevent the rocks from advancing.
Half Broken crates and slightly torn bags of food are scattered everywhere. Flies swarm overhead, and what little vegetables they seem willing to eat lays side-by-side with raw meat.
A large chair placed upon a bone pile is the focal point of this section, Torches burn on either side, and animal rugs lead up to the seat.
A bone pile mixed in iron scrap and cloth to one side, and on the other, a table with make-shift tools. Some small pieces of “clothes” and armor hang from hooks.
